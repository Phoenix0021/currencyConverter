## Learning Custom Hooks

In the course of learning React, a small project was developed that involved the creation of custom hooks. 
This experience facilitated a deeper understanding of encapsulating reusable logic and managing state more effectively within functional components. 
The implementation of these custom hooks enhanced the functionality of the project and contributed to cleaner, more maintainable code.
